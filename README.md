***UPDATES LOG***;
2-22-2024; Works well on high quantities and timeframes > 1W. Sufficient helpful error handling so that it probably won't break on you, but some features do get disabled if your data is small. Will iron out in future commits.

***DESCRIPTION***;

This script is designed to create a clean net-sales report for your Amazon business. It takes in the following FBA reports; 
	-sales data 
	-returns data
	-remaining in stock data	
	-cogs (per unit cost for each of your products)

The script will ask you to specify a brandname, and run you an excel sales report for the specified products, for the date range that you specified when downloading the data files.

It will return a relatively rich yet quick sales report with a time-series chart, and breakdown of your sales, in-stock, and returns. There are also some helpful metrics such as return rate, avg daily sales, overall net for the period, etc. It's not reinventing the wheel, but it's a great way to keep an eye on your sales trends. I usually present it to clients and then dig deeper on whatever they want to have a closer look at. 

Works best for timeframes >1 week, otherwise the entire premise of the linechart is made useless. For daily sales and other small time-frames, I use a different report, will share on github later.
